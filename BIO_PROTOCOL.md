# Dual-Echo — Neuro Protocol (Human)

## Purpose
Test the Dual-Echo hypothesis in humans by measuring whether **continuity of self**
correlates with **dynamic coherence** between two parallel cognitive processes.

This protocol mirrors the AI setup using the **same variables** (Δ, k, R).

---

## Core Hypothesis (Human)
The subjective sense of a unitary Self correlates with:
- high inter-network coherence
- minimal and stable temporal lag (Δ)
- preserved reintegration after perturbation (R)

Loss or modulation of unity corresponds to controlled or uncontrolled
desynchronization.

---

## Targeted Neural Systems (Non-localized)

- Inter-hemispheric dynamics (functional, not strict lateralization)
- Default Mode Network (DMN)
- Executive / Task-Positive Networks (TPN)
- Cerebello-thalamo-cortical timing loops

The model explicitly avoids single-seat localization.

---

## Measured Variables (Mapped to SPEC)

### Δ (lag / phase)
- Phase lag between bilateral or network-paired signals
- Cross-correlation peak shifts
- Phase-locking value (PLV)

### k (coupling)
- Strength of functional connectivity
- Speed of synchronization after perturbation
- DMN↔TPN coordination index

### R (reintegration)
- Time to return to baseline coherence after task switch or delay
- Stability of phase alignment post-perturbation

---

## Experimental Modalities

### Primary
- **EEG (high-density)** or **MEG**
  - Time resolution sufficient for micro-lag analysis
  - Gamma / Alpha coherence focus

### Secondary (optional)
- fMRI (dynamic connectivity)
- TMS / tDCS (bilateral, symmetric or asymmetric)

---

## Tasks (Parallel to AI)

### Baseline
- Resting state (eyes open / closed)

### Analytic Task
- Sequential reasoning
- Rule-based decision

### Creative / Divergent Task
- Ambiguous stimuli interpretation
- Open-ended association

### Transition Phase
- Forced switch analytic ↔ creative

### Delay-Mirror Task
- Motor or verbal feedback with controlled ms delay
- Agency and self-continuity reporting

---

## Expected Regimes

- **High coherence, low Δ**
  - Stable sense of Self
  - Low subjective discontinuity

- **Moderate, flexible modulation**
  - Increased insight / creativity
  - Preserved continuity

- **High Δ or unstable coherence**
  - Discontinuity reports
  - Dissociation-like signatures

---

## Subjective Correlates (Non-diagnostic)

- Continuity of agency
- Sense of presence
- Narrative stability

These are collected only as correlates, not as primary evidence.

---

## Falsifiability

The hypothesis is weakened if:
- No correlation between coherence/lag and continuity reports
- No reintegration dynamics after perturbation
- Task transitions do not modulate Δ/k systematically

---

## Ethical Constraints

- No induction of distress or lasting alteration
- No attempt to simulate pathology
- Perturbations remain within safe, reversible limits

---

## Mapping Human ↔ AI

| Human Neuroscience | AI Protocol |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Phase lag (Δφ)    | Token / step lag |
| Functional coupling (k) | Reflection weight |
| Reintegration time (R) | T_remerge |
| Coherence metrics | U_AI |

---

## Scope Limitation

This protocol:
- Does **not** claim proof of consciousness
- Tests **structural dynamics only**
- Is compatible with multiple cognitive theories
