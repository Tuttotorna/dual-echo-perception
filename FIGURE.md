# Dual-Echo — Figure 1 (Regime Map)

## Figure
**dual_echo_regime_map.png**

## What it shows (minimal)
This heatmap reports the mean unity proxy **U = exp(-|H1 - H2|)** over a sweep of:
- **k** (coupling strength)
- **Δε** (micro-divergence)

Each cell is the mean U over a fixed-length run of the dual-stream dynamics.

## Regime reading (operational)
- **High U**: stable alignment (unitary regime)
- **Intermediate U**: controlled divergence + reintegration (flexible regime)
- **Low U**: persistent divergence / fragmentation (unstable regime)
