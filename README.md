# Dual-Echo — The Perception of the Self (IT/EN)

This repository is a **fixed starting point** for the Dual-Echo line:
- a **phenomenological layer** (human-readable, non-reduced)
- preserved in **Italian and English**
- with a clean separation from any code or benchmarks

## Texts

- Italian: `docs/perception-of-self.it.md`
- English: `docs/perception-of-self.en.md`

## Scope

- No experiments here.
- No claims here.
- Only the **canonical text layer** in two languages, versioned and immutable by commits.
