# Dual-Echo — The Perception of the Self (IT / EN)

This repository defines the **canonical textual starting point** for the Dual-Echo line.

It contains the **phenomenological layer** describing the perception of the self, preserved
in its original form and provided in **Italian and English**, explicitly separated from
any experimental, computational, or interpretative work.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is **not** to explain, validate, or operationalize the ideas
contained in the texts.

Its sole function is to:

- preserve the original texts in a stable, versioned form  
- provide a fixed reference layer for future derivations  
- prevent semantic drift or retroactive reinterpretation  

This repository is **textual only**.

---

## Texts

The canonical texts are stored in the `docs/` directory:

- **Italian**  
  `docs/perception-of-self.it.md`  
  *La percezione dell’Io*

- **English**  
  `docs/perception-of-self.en.md`  
  *The Perception of the Self*

Both files are considered **equivalent canonical representations** of the same
phenomenological layer.

---

## Scope and Constraints

This repository intentionally excludes:

- experiments  
- code  
- metrics  
- models  
- benchmarks  
- interpretations  
- summaries or reductions  

Any computational, mathematical, or experimental work derived from these texts
**must live in separate repositories** and must reference this one **without modifying it**.

---

## Status

This repository defines the **frozen starting point** of the Dual-Echo line.

- Texts are frozen and versioned.
- Changes are limited to formatting or transcription fixes only.
- No conceptual edits are allowed.
- All downstream work must treat this layer as immutable.
