# Dual-Echo — The Perception of the Self (IT / EN)

This repository defines the **canonical textual starting point** for the Dual-Echo line.

It contains the **phenomenological layer** describing the perception of the self,
preserved in its original form and provided in **Italian and English**.
This layer is explicitly separated from any experimental, computational,
or interpretative work.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is **not** to explain, validate, simplify,
or operationalize the ideas contained in the texts.

Its sole function is to:

- preserve the original texts in a stable, versioned form  
- provide a fixed reference layer for all future derivations  
- prevent semantic drift, reinterpretation, or retroactive alignment  

This repository is **textual only**.

---

## Texts

The canonical texts are stored in the `docs/` directory:

- **Italian**  
  `docs/perception-of-self.it.md`  
  *La percezione dell’Io*

- **English**  
  `docs/perception-of-self.en.md`  
  *The Perception of the Self*

The Italian and English versions are considered **equivalent canonical representations**
of the same phenomenological layer.

---

## Scope and Constraints

This repository intentionally excludes:

- experiments  
- source code  
- models  
- metrics  
- benchmarks  
- interpretations  
- summaries or reductions  

Any computational, mathematical, or experimental work derived from these texts
**must live in separate repositories** and must reference this one
**without modifying it**.

---

## Status

This repository defines the **frozen starting point** of the Dual-Echo line.

- Texts are frozen and versioned.
- Only formatting or transcription fixes are allowed.
- No conceptual edits are permitted.
- All downstream work must treat this layer as immutable.

---

## Canonical Reference

This repository is the **immutable textual reference** for the Dual-Echo framework.

- Italian and English texts are canonical and equivalent.
- No conceptual divergence between languages is allowed.
- All future Dual-Echo artifacts must cite this repository as their textual origin.
